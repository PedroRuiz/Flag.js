# Flag.js

Flag js is a class for build to run in React to get countries flag with a simple sintax and effective renter time.

## Dependencies
It has only three dependencies:
* React (obviously)
* prop-types
* flag-icon-css

## Use
Simply do \<Flag flag="string"> when string is the code of the flag you want. As I use 'bg' as 'en' this translate every 'en' in 'gb' flag. You can delete this if not runs well for you.
